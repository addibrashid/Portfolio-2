            <p>Stan Lee and Steve Ditko first introduced Spider-Man in Amazing Fantasy back in 1962, when teen
                superheroes
                were
                almost exclusively sidekicks. Peter Parker's adolescent struggles spoke to younger readers, prompting
                him to
                become one of the most beloved characters in the Marvel Universe
